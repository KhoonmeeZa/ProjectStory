Install Node using command
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhoonmeeZa/ProjectStory/main/install_story.sh)

When running for a while, input the desired Node or Moniker name.
Wait until it's finished.

Install Snapshot using command
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhoonmeeZa/ProjectStory/main/install_Snapshot.sh)

Wait until it's finished. 
This may take several minutes or hours because the file is large, 90gb or more.
